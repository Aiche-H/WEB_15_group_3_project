## Version Control and Update Procedures

## Version Control Guidelines

### Branching Strategy
We will use a feature-based branching model.

* **main** branch: Represents the stable, production-ready code.
* **feature/[feature_name]** branches: Used for developing new features.

### Workflow
1. **Clone the repo you want to work on**
    ```bash
    git clone <repsitory_url>
    ```

**If the repo is already cloned to your local enviorement**
    ```bash
    git fetch origin main
    git diff <merge-base>
    git merge origin/main
    ```

**If confident there is no conflicts**
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```
    
This command is equivalent to running git fetch origin main followed by git merge origin/main. It fetches the latest commits from the remote main branch and immediately merges them into your current working branch.

2. **Create a new feature branch** 
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
   ```

3. **After you are done with your Work on the new branch**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "<commit message>"
    git push origin <current working_branch_name>
    ```

**alternatively**
    ```bash
    git commit -am "comment here"
    git push origin <current working_branch_name>
    ```
this command combines two common Git operations (git add . & git commit -m "comment here")

4. **create a pull request on github**
    -Go to the repository on GitHub in your web browser.
    -Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
    -Click on the "New pull request" button.
    -In the "head repository" dropdown, select your forked repository.
    -In the "compare" dropdown, select your feature branch.
    -Click on "Create pull request."

## If Working On a Repo You Are Not a Collaborator Or Is Not Yours

## Workflow

1. **Fork the repo you want to work on in github**
    -Visit the repository you want to fork on GitHub.
    -Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page.
    -Choose a destination repository for your fork, such as your personal account.

2. **Clone the forked repository from your own accounts repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repsitory_url>
   ```

3. **Set Up Upstream Remote**
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
    ```

4. **Fetch Changes from Upstream**
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```

5. **Create a new branch** 
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
   ```

6. **After you are done with your Work on the new branch**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "<commit message>"
    git push origin <current working_branch_name>
    ```

**alternatively**
    ```bash
    git commit -am "comment here"
    git push origin <current working_branch_name>
    ```
this command combines two common Git operations (git add . & git commit -m "comment here")

6. **create a pull request on github**
    -On GitHub, navigate to your forked repository.
    -Go to the "Pull Requests" tab.
    -Click "New pull request."
    -Select the feature/your_feature_name branch as the "head repository" and the main branch of the original repository as the "base repository."
    -Provide a clear description of your changes and submit the pull request.

## Additional tips

## Generating a ssh key

1.   **Check for Existing Keys**
    -navigate to C:\Users\Your_username\.ssh

2.   **If you don't have an SSH key, type the following command**
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

4. **Adding the Public Key to GitHub**
    -Go to your GitHub account settings.
    -Navigate to "SSH and GPG keys".
    -Click "New SSH key".
    -Paste the contents of your public key into the "Key" field.
    -Give the key a descriptive name (e.g., "Your Computer").
    -Click "Add SSH key".

5. **Using SSH Keys with Git**
   
    ```bash
    git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/<your private key file>"
    ```
    
6.  **Test SSH Connectivity**
    ```bash
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

**If successful** 
    You should see a message like "Hi [your username]! You've connected to GitHub using SSH."
